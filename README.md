Facial detection, tracking, recognition and saving via live camera feed. 

Must give it a pre-existing database of faces (possibly from webscraping Instagram / other social media platforms so long as it remains legal)

Once it detects a face on the camera, it will save said face and upload it to a google cloud storage every 'x' seconds under a file named after the detected person. 

Currently, it works by datascraping Instagram pages, and detects faces based on their Instagram handle. 

Runs at ~11-15 fps.
